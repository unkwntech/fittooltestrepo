# Augoror Navy Issue 
Intermediate level armor cruiser

## Description
A simple laser boat with a wide engagement profile against most Amarr compositions. Best paired with Stabber Fleet Issue to reduce the effectiveness of Reactive Armor Hardeners.

Keeping at range (instead of approaching or orbiting) is critical for your tracking.
