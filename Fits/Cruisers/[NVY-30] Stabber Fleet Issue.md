# Stabber Fleet Issue
Intermediate level armor cruiser

## Description
A simple autocannon boat with a wide engagement profile against most Amarr compositions. Best paired with Augoror Navy Issue to reduce the effectiveness of Reactive Armor Hardeners.

Keeping at range (instead of approaching or orbiting) is critical for your tracking. Highly recommend keeping at range 3-5km to apply maximum damage. 

Hail never fails.
