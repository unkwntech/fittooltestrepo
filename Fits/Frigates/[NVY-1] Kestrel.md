# Kestrel

Solo Kestrel fit


## Description

The Kestrel is one of the strongest T1 frigate and one of the easiest to fly, with a lot of tank, no problem for tracking (allowing it to fly for mitigation against turrets) and very good DPS. The shield buffer variant is fast and tanky but only has a single web, requiring the use of faction rockets against other afterburning frigates. For the rat in the plexes use rage for maximum DPS.
