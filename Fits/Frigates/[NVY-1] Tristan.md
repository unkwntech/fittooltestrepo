# Tristan

Solo Tristan fit


## Description

A kiting Tristan designed to safely engage from range using drones. Don't rush to secure a point too early, rather kite at the edge of your point using your drone to apply damage and when you feel like the fight is in your favor go and secure the point before the enemy warp out. Despite your tank a scram/web frigate will murder you upclose as you can't mitigate any damage: don't punch in a plex against an opponent already setup.
