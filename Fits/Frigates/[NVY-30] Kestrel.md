# Kestrel
Entry level alpha composition 

## Description
The Kestrel is an excellent alternative to the Talwar, primarily for scout complexes. High missile alpha and long range make it suitable for nearly any situation as a cheap way to highly impact a grid. 

The next level up is the Caldari Navy Hookbill or Talwar, which packs nearly twice the alpha.
