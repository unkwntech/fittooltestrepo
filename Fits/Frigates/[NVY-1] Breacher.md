# Breacher

Solo Breacher fit


## Description

A solo Breacher fit aimed at 1v1 against T1 frigates. The breacher is one of the strongest T1 frigates in plex fight IF the reps are properly micro-managed. Both ancillary reps should be pulse and heated, with proper use of the armor and hull to make sure than no EHP is left unused. If shield reps are used first, the remaining buffer won't be enough to use all the pasted armor rep. Rage rockets should be used against rats, against other AB frigates a single web require the use of faction.
