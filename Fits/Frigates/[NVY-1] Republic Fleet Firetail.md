# Republic Fleet Firetail

Solo Republic Fleet Firetail fit


## Description

A solo frigate fit for the RFF, aimed at scram kiting at ~8km with artillery. The fast speed and double web allow the RFF to control the range and pilots should use the Keep-At-Range command at their optimal range (7.8km with perfect skills). The high alpha of artillery makes it a great counter against active tanked frigate and the range control allows it to fight brawlers such as the blaster comet. Hookbills and rail comets should be avoided as they are the worst frigate to face.
