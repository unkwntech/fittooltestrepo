# Caldari Navy Hookbill

Solo Caldari Navy Hookbill fit


## Description

The triple tanked Caldari Navy Hookbill, one of the most feared frigate of Faction Warfare. Just like the Breacher, having double reps requires a bit of micro-management in order to not waste any EHP. However, contrary to the Breacher the Bulkheads make bleeding armor and hull a bit safer. All the reps should be used heated. In this frigate use your scram and double web to control the range of the fight with orbit to mitigate the damage and focus on your tank.
