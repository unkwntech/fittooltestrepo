# Ferox
Entry level shield battlecruiser

## Description
The Ferox is an excellent, cheap alternative to the Cyclone Fleet Issue. Blasters are disgusting when the enemy is forced to slide into a complex, busting your engagement range wide open. 

Spreading scramblers and focusing on primaries will seal the deal against any fleet. 

Best paired with the Drake.
