# Hurricane

Shield Fleet AC Hurricane

## Description
A third battlecruiser to round off our cheap shield battlecruiser doctrine, the autocannon Hurricane is not as tanky
as the Drake or the Ferox. However, it gets something in return: damage. This fit outputs a 950 DPS cold with Hail
topping at 1100 hot. Paired with some applications from other BCs (webs/scram painters), a fleet of Hurricane will
grind down on anything thrown into it.
